          <h1>Schneider Joachim's Biography!</h1>
          <p>
            Welcome! My name is Schneider Joachim. I am a student at the iSchool in Syracuse University, located in my hometown of Syracuse NY.<br>
            <br>I am working towards earning a major in Data Analytics with a concentration in Web Development and Management.  
            My goal is to have a career leveraging data as an API Developer using the skills I'm learning in the iSchool.<br>
            <br>I am proud to share some of my accomplishments as a student such as: 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Earning an internship opportunity</li>
            <li>Playing a role in organizing memorable events for my campus community across three organizations</li> 
          </ul>

          <h2>Personal Information</h2>
          <p>
            Outside of school and work, I code simple stuff for fun occasionally. It may sound cliche but it's actually one of my hobbies, and helps me retain the muscle memory that comes with this field. 
            
            I <strong>love</strong> nature and capturing the moment through photography. It helps me get unglued from one screen to another and appreciate the world around me.<br>
            <br>I also enjoy longboarding on a day with nice weather, and it helps me stay fit!
            When I'm not enjoying what this planet has to offer, I spend time with my family and friends. I help my mom with her small business and learn from her; she has inspired me to start my own entrepreneurial endeavors one day.<br>
            <br>Being the oldest sibling, I find myself often guiding my younger siblings with advice and help in their lives.
            My friends and I enjoy playing video games; it's always a fun destressor to partake in.
            Such a work-life balance allows me to enjoy the journey earning my major, while still having time to still be human and enjoy life.
