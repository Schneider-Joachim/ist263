            <h2>Personal Information</h2>
            <p>
                Outside of school and work, I code simple stuff for fun occasionally. It may sound cliche but it's actually one of my hobbies, and helps me retain the muscle memory that comes with this field. 
             
                 I <strong>love</strong> nature and capturing the moment through photography. It helps me get unglued from one screen to another and appreciate the world around me.<br>
                 <br>I also enjoy longboarding on a day with nice weather, and it helps me stay fit!
                When I'm not enjoying what this planet has to offer, I spend time with my family and friends. I help my mom with her small business and learn from her, she has inspired me to start my own entrepreneurial endeavors one day.<br>
                <br>Being the oldest sibling, I find myself often guiding my younger siblings with advice and help in their lives.
                My friends and I enjoy playing video games, it's always a fun destressor to partake in.
                 Such a work-life balance allows me to enjoy the journey earning my major, while still having time to still be human and enjoy life.
